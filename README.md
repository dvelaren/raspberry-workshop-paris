## Class examples
Below you can see the examples explanation and connection for each class:

### Class 1 - Raspberry Fundamentals
This class covers:
1. Introduction.
2. Raspberry Pi 3 Rev B Specs.
3. Detailed GPIO Pinout.
4. Raspberry Pi 3 Required Equipment.
5. Raspberry Pi 3 Operative Systems
6. Raspbian Basic CLI Commands.
7. Python common functions with Raspberry
8. Python Variables
9. Python Typical Operators
10. Python Program Structure for HW

#### Example 1.1 – Python common used commands
In PIN 40 (GPIO21) there is a LED (L1) connected. Blink the LED ½ second ON and ½ second OFF.

#### Example 1.2 – If statement with digital input
In the PIN 36 (GPIO16) there is a switch (SW) and in the PIN 40 there is a LED (L1). Turn ON the LED if the switch is activated, in other case, turn off the LED.
